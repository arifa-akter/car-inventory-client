                        <p>
                        javascript is most popular language other side node js is javascript 
                        run time environment node js help in server side.we use any language in 
                        backend side but if we want to one language in both side then use node js and javascript.
                        Node.js is the greatest tool for building real-time web applications .Node.js is primarily used for non-blocking, 
                        event-driven servers, due to its single-threaded nature. if we made big communication web application such as a facebook and twiter
                        then we used node js.
